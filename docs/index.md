# Quickstart

NuGetizer is a drop-in replacement for the .NET SDK built-in Pack (a.k.a. "SDK Pack") 
which instantly supercharges your ability to customize and extend the packing process 
in a consistent and easy to understand process designed and centered around best 
practices in MSBuild design and extensibility.

Yes, this means you'll never need to write a `.nuspec` by hand ever again, no matter 
how complicated or advanced your packing scenarios are.
