# Contributing

You can contribute to the project with issues and PRs. 
Simply filing issues for problems you encounter is a great way to contribute. Contributing implementations is greatly appreciated.

## Before you file a bug...
* Is this a question, or are you looking for help? Ask it in the project's **Discussions** tab instead, if available.

* Did you search the issues list to see if someone already reported it? _When looking for duplicates, make sure to look through open **and** closed issues._
* Did you create a simple repro for the problem? _We won't look at your bug until you provide a repro project or complete repro steps._

## Before you submit a PR...

* Did you ensure there is a corresponding issue labelled as ðŸŸ¢ help wanted? 
  If not, please open one to start the discussion.
* Does the code follow existing coding styles? (spaces, comments, no regions, etc.)?
  We enforce the basic styles by running `dotnet format` on the repository root. 
  You can do the same before submitting a PR to speed up the process.
* Did you write unit tests?
  Typically required if there are other unit tests for existing or related code.

## Looking for something to work on?
