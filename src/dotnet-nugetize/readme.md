The `nugetize` dotnet global tool (available after installation) allows quick iteration while creating nuget packages.

It works together with [NuGetizer](https://nuget.org/packages/NuGetizer) to provide the most productive solution for your packing needs.

The following is the output of a comprehensive [smart multi-targeted library](https://www.cazzulino.com/smart-libraries.html#packaging) example:

![nugetize smart library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlooped/nugetizer/main/img/complete.png)

NuGetizer provides support for running all the samples in the [documentation](https://www.clarius.org/nugetizer/) directly in your browser in a [![GitHub Codespace](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GitHub%20Codespace-black?logo=github)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=docs&repo=297430130&machine=basicLinux32gb&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json).

As soon as the codespace is running, just use the terminal to go to the desired sample directory and just run `nugetize`!

> NOTE: `dotnet-nugetize` does not support projects that don't reference the [NuGetizer](https://nuget.org/packages/NuGetizer) package.
